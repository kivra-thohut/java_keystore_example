## About

The terms "Serverlegitimation" and "Stämpellegitimation" are specific to certain contexts and may not be universally recognized. However, they generally refer to different types of digital certificates or authentication mechanisms. Here's a simplified explanation:

## Serverlegitimation
Serverlegitimation typically refers to server authentication, which is the process of verifying the identity of a server to a client. This is commonly used in SSL/TLS protocols to ensure that clients are communicating with the legitimate server.

### Key Points:
Purpose: To authenticate the server to the client.
Usage: Commonly used in HTTPS to secure web communications.
Example: When you visit a website with HTTPS, the server presents an SSL/TLS certificate to prove its identity.

## Stämpellegitimation
Stämpellegitimation (literally "stamp authentication") is less commonly used and may refer to a form of digital signature or seal that verifies the authenticity and integrity of a document or transaction. This term might be used in specific industries or regions to denote a particular type of digital certification.

### Key Points:
Purpose: To authenticate documents or transactions.
Usage: Can be used in legal, financial, or governmental contexts to ensure the authenticity of documents.
Example: A digital signature on a PDF document that verifies the document has not been altered and confirms the identity of the signer.
Summary
Serverlegitimation:

## Examples

Purpose: Server authentication.
Usage: Securing web communications (e.g., HTTPS).
Example: SSL/TLS certificates used by websites.
Stämpellegitimation:

Purpose: Document or transaction authentication.
Usage: Ensuring the authenticity and integrity of documents.
Example: Digital signatures on legal documents.
Visual Representation
Serverlegitimation:

Client <-> Server (Server presents SSL/TLS certificate to authenticate itself to the client).
Stämpellegitimation:

Document <-> Digital Signature (Document is signed with a digital signature to verify its authenticity and integrity).
These terms may have specific meanings in certain contexts, so it's always a good idea to refer to the relevant documentation or standards for precise definitions.
